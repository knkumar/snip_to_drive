Are you looking for an quick and painless way to stash away useful
pieces of information while navigating the web?  How about saving
those pieces "in the clouds", using Google Drive?

"Snip to Drive" is a Google Chrome browser extension that allows you
to save snippets from web pages as documents in Google Drive -- select
parts of a webpage, edit the default title if you would like to, and
save.  See the screenshot for for a better idea about how it works.

The documents are saved in a directory named "snipped_from_chrome" in
your Drive.  The extension will need to authenticate, of course.
